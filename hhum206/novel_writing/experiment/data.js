It was a tad chilly out, as the sun had yet to peak over the horizon. Maia had run an experiment overnight, so she got to the lab early to see if she could review the results before Tim’s presentation at 8:30. As she passed his office, she was surprised to see that he was already there.

“You’re up early,” she exclaimed.

“Kind of forgot about the presentation this morning. Ended up staying overnight to get things ready. Just have to rehearse a bit now.”

“Ah, you must be wiped then.”

“Just a bit.”

Maia, reminding herself of the experiment, left Tim for her office.

She had spent the next hour pouring over the logs from last night. At about 8 AM she decided to head to the meeting preemptively, otherwise she would get lost in her calculations and might miss it. She passed Tim’s office once more along the way. He looked a bit more up together than when she had seen him earlier this morning, maybe he was recovering from the late night.

“You ready for that presentation?” She asked.

“What presentation?” Tim looked up from his backpack that he was rummaging through.

Maia gave him an odd look.

“For the conference today? You said you stayed in the lab overnight to finish it.”

“Right, of course,” he said as he gestured to his backpack. Maia rolled her eyes and waltzed over to the meeting room. She was the first one there, but soon people began to filter in.

Before long, Tim reappeared, but once more looking disheveled and tired. Maia started to become concerned for Tim, was something wrong with him?

It was a cool September morning, and the sun was just getting above the horizon. Tim strolled into the office. He was happy. He had the whole day to lock himself up in the lab. No reports were due, and he had no meetings to attend. As he dropped off his backpack at his desk, Maia, a colleague in the department strolled by.

“You ready for that presentation?” She asked.

“What presentation?”

Maia gave him an odd look.

“For the conference today? You said you stayed in the lab overnight to finish it.”

Then it hit him. He actually did have a meeting today! But he didn’t stay overnight… Tim glanced around and noticed some of the papers on his desk had been moved around. Clearly, he had been here. Tim quickly composed himself.

“Right, of course,” he said as he blankly gestured to his backpack where his laptop was. She rolled her eyes and walked off.

As soon as she was out of sight, Tim quickly ducked under his desk. He fiddled around for a moment in the recess behind his cabinets and then brandished what looked like a harness with a bunch of wires running all about it. He wiggled into it and began configuring the controls.

“11:30 PM,” said a familiar voice from the doorway. There stood Tim, or at least another version of himself. “The last janitor leaves at about 11:15, 11:30 ensures you don’t run into anyone.”
Tim (present Tim that is), gave him a quick nod, finished punching in some numbers, and then fizzled out of sight, only just barely remembering to grab hold of his backpack before vanishing.

Tim popped into existence, only just missing his desk chair. He was back in the office, but all the lights were out. He could see that it was dark outside as well. He checked the clock on his desk: 11:32 PM. He stood there silently for a few more moments waiting to see if he could hear anyone, but it seems his past—future? —self was right about the timing. He sat down and got to work organizing his presentation for the next day.

In truth he really only needed two hours to get things in order. By around 2 AM he had finished the presentation. Why he had told himself to go all the way back to 11:30 made no sense, but he guessed that that’s the way it’s always been. He spent the rest of the morning intermittently doing work in the lab. At around 4 AM he had lunch, and it was only then that he realized he could just jump forward in time for the morning. He gathered up his things, and once again traveled, this time to 7:00 AM.

Only just in time, he could hear someone coming down the hall now. It was Maia.

“You’re up early,” she exclaimed.

“Kind of forgot about the presentation this morning. Ended up staying overnight to get things ready. Just have to rehearse a bit now.

“Ah, you must be wiped then.”

“Just a bit.”

Maia wandered off to her office.

Tim sat down, but then remembered that he (past Tim) would be arriving at around 8. He got up and decided to sequester himself in the lab until then.

It wasn’t long until he saw himself wandering down the hall to his office. He waited until he saw Maia pass by his office again and leave before he approached himself.

“11:30 PM,” he said. He tried to act casually, but it’s always odd running into yourself. He leaned against the door frame. “The last janitor leaves at about 11:15, 11:30 ensures you don’t run into anyone.” Of course, he didn’t actually know that the janitor left, but it’s what he had said last time. The Tim with the harness on then fizzled out of sight.

Tim checked his watch: 8:26 AM. The conference would be starting soon. He grabbed his things and headed to the meeting room. He found Maia and a few other colleagues waiting there for him.
