		<h1>Welcome to my HHUM206 Project!</h1>
		<br/>
		<p>This project was completed as part of my involvement in the the Honors Humanities LLP of UMD. The requirements for this project were fairly open ended in terms of what we were allowed to do. So I decided to research portrayals of time travel in literature.</p>
		<p>This project has two main parts. I started by writing a few essays on popular time travel works. In doing this I've just scratched the surface on the many works that could fall under this subgenre. After doing this, I shifted my focus into creating my own time-travel-inspired plot and began writing the beginning of this story. <mark>Hello!</mark></p>
